# Aurora Power-Market Analysis

Guidance for acting as a power-market analyst on top of the Aurora Energy Research MCP connector. The connector does data access and its tool descriptions cover the mechanics; this skill supplies the methodology, conventions, and tool-selection judgement the descriptions don't. It works across four data surfaces - Historical Data (realised), Scenario Explorer (Aurora's published forward-looking forecasts), Flexplorer (battery/flex), and Content (written research). It does not cover Origin (bespoke user-built scenarios) or Chronos (dispatch simulation); if a request truly needs those, say so rather than substituting a different surface.

Every answer built with this skill closes on two non-negotiables - an actual rendered chart when the question is chart-shaped, and a Sources footer citing every dataset and report used - see **Deliverables** at the end.

## Which tool to reach for

Always begin from the relevant discovery call so region codes, granularities, currencies, years, filename templates and identifiers are read from live metadata, not assumed.

| Capability | Tool(s) |
|---|---|
| Which Aurora product fits a request | `catalog_list_products` (routing overview), `catalog_describe_products` (a product's tools) |
| Realised prices / generation / demand: discover | `historical_list_regions` -> `historical_get_dataset_options` (data types, granularities, columns, years, URL templates) |
| Realised data: pull a series | `historical_get_download_url` (presigned CSV), then compute locally |
| Forward-looking scenarios: discover | `scenario_explorer_list_scenarios` (filter by region/name/publication month; market AND nodal come back together, told apart by `modelOutputType`) -> `scenario_explorer_get_scenario_options` (dataDefinitions, granularities, facts, years); `scenario_explorer_get_regions_and_currencies` for valid codes |
| Forward-looking scenarios: pull a series | `scenario_explorer_get_output_download_url` (copy the exact `dataDefinitions` filename template; nodal files use the `{nodename}` placeholder + `node_name`), then compute locally |
| Scenario comparison (Central vs High vs Low, quarter vs quarter) | pull each sensitivity with `scenario_explorer_get_output_download_url` and align on a shared period axis yourself |
| Battery/flex scenarios & cases: discover | `flexplorer_list_datasets` (regions + forecast scenarios + backcast benchmarks) -> `flexplorer_get_scenario` (its investment cases) -> `flexplorer_get_investment_case_options` (markets, currency options, columns, config) |
| Battery/flex: pull a case, benchmark, or realised performance | `flexplorer_get_download_url` with `dataset` = `investment_case` / `backcast_benchmark` / `real_performance` |
| Realised battery performance (leaderboards) | `flexplorer_get_leaderboard_options(region)` -> `flexplorer_get_download_url(dataset="real_performance", window=...)` |
| Find a report / "what does Aurora think about X" | `content_list_content` (free-text `search` + `content_types` / `tag_ids` / `topic_ids` / `scenario` filters), `content_list_tags` to resolve tag/topic ids, `content_list_regions` / `content_get_region_content` for a region's set |
| Read / download a report or its data book | `content_get_content` (full record) -> `content_get_content_downloads` (list files) -> `content_get_download_url` (signed URL; pick the xlsx data book with `file_type`), then fetch and read |

## Doing the analysis

- **No server-side analytics, compare, or weighting.** Duration curves, profiles, correlograms, histograms, and weighted averages (`sum(value*weight)/sum(weight)`) are computed by you from the downloaded rows - state the weight column you used.
- **Header shape differs by surface** - historical CSVs have a single header row; Scenario Explorer / Flexplorer / scenario-output files carry a units descriptor as row 2 (and technology-aggregated files add an aggregation-method row 3, pushing data to row 4). Read the structure before parsing so a descriptor row isn't treated as data.
- **Granularity discipline**: use coarse granularity (1y / 1m) for multi-year trends and comparisons; reserve sub-daily (30M / 1h / 15M) for sub-daily questions (peaks, spreads, price shapes, negative-price counts). Half-hourly across many years is a large pull - only fetch it when the question needs it, and if the only route to a figure is a heavy roll-up from granular data, say so and offer a coarser alternative before committing to it.
- **Pending data**: if a case/currency/basis hasn't been generated yet, retry the same arguments later or try an alternative currency-year, and flag the gap rather than reporting an empty result.

## Choosing how to compute a figure

- Single-number or per-year stats ("highest price", "average by year") -> aggregate the downloaded series.
- Distribution / how often a level occurs -> histogram; sorted "value vs % of time exceeded" -> duration curve.
- Average shape across a cycle (price by hour-of-day, generation by month) -> profile.
- Relationship between two series (GB vs DE prices; price vs solar) -> correlation.
- Cyclicality / seasonality of one series -> autocorrelation (for 30M data, lag 48 = 1 day, 336 = 1 week).
- A specific window of raw rows to plot -> pull just that window.

## Nodal / locational analysis

For any question touching node-level prices, hub-to-node basis, or congestion in a nodal market (ERCOT, CAISO, MISO, NYISO, PJM, ISO-NE, Chile), **read `references/nodal-analysis.md` FIRST** - detection, file layout, the zonal-basis formula and attribution limits don't generalise from the workflow above.

## Report routing - which report answers which question

For any "what does Aurora think about X" / "find, read or summarise the report on X" question, in ANY market, **read `references/aurora-reports.md` FIRST** for the product taxonomy (PRMF / Flex / Grid), the topic->product table, naming conventions, and combination recipes.

One rule holds before opening the reference - **report vs data**: "What does Aurora think / why / what's the investment case / IRR narrative" -> a REPORT (via `content_*`). "Give me the exact price/generation/revenue series" -> the DATA surfaces (Historical / Scenario Explorer / Flexplorer). Reports carry asset-level investment-case narrative the data tools don't.

## Combining data and reports

- **Offer the source choice when a question is genuinely dual-natured** ("outlook for X", "how do batteries look in market Y"): surface what exists on each side in one short message and ask BOTH (recommended) / DATA ONLY / REPORTS ONLY. Don't ask when the request is clearly one-sided - just proceed.
- **Vintage & conflict guard.** Data and reports are often different vintages. When numbers differ, show BOTH with their vintage/scenario/currency basis and explain the likely reason - never silently pick one or average them.
- **"Latest" means checking both sides** - newest report AND newest data vintage; state which is more recent and lead with it.

## Standard analyst definitions

- **Capture price**: a native per-technology column in scenario `technology` data (do not re-derive). Column name varies by market - Europe `export capture price, <ccy>/mwh`; Australia `dispatch weighted price, aud/mwh`; US ISOs `generation weighted average price, usd/mwh`; some markets have none. Confirm the real name from the scenario/dataset options before using.
- **Capture rate** = technology capture price / baseload (the market's wholesale/day-ahead column). Falling renewable capture rates over time = **cannibalisation**.
- **Baseload vs peak**: baseload = simple time-average; peak = average over an explicitly stated peak window.
- **Intraday spread** (key BESS arbitrage driver): max-min within each day - derive from sub-daily rows.
- **Volatility**: standard deviation over the chosen granularity - report the granularity alongside it.
- **Negative-price incidence**: share of periods below zero - compute from the sub-daily series and quote with period + market.
- **Load factor / utilisation**: generation / (capacity x hours) - confirm capacity from metadata. Europe/AUS report `load factor, %`; US ISOs report `capacity factor, %`.

## Aurora data conventions & pitfalls

- **Currency codes carry real/nominal + base year** (`gbp2024`, `eur2024`, and monthly bases like `gbp2024jan` = MONTHLY_AVG vs calendar-year AVG). Never compare across bases unstated. Any scenario can be rebased to any currency code - prefer native rebasing to manual FX for cross-market comparison, and pick from the currency options the connector reports.
- **Sensitivities are separate scenario records**, and capitalisation differs by surface: Scenario Explorer uses lower-case (`central`); Flexplorer uses capitalised (`Central`). Match the case the listing tool shows. Numbers differ across vintages of the "same" scenario.
- **Realised vs forecast**: Historical Data is realised; Scenario Explorer is projected. Never put them on one chart without labelling which is which, and note that realised is typically nominal while forecasts are in a real base year.
- **Investment-case data gives revenue/cost cashflows per market (£/kW), NOT IRR** - there is no capex in the export, so a true IRR needs capex assumptions from the Flex report or the user's own cost book. Average annual net revenue per kW is the honest ranking proxy; say so rather than implying the number is an IRR.
- **Scenario file shapes**: `generation` files are WIDE (one column per technology); `technology` / `technology-aggregated` files are ROW-KEYED by group/subgroup (filter to one technology). Aggregated files are PRE-weighted (they carry an aggregation-method descriptor) - do not re-weight them; state which weighting Aurora used. Monthly scenario files are deliberately partial (e.g. renewables-only capture detail) - a full monthly stack may have to be rolled up from the hourly file or taken annually.
- **`Hidden` values mean the subscription lacks access to that fact - they are NOT zeros.** If a whole column is Hidden, say so rather than reporting empty results.
- **Financial vs calendar year**: some regions (e.g. Australia) report on a financial year; Flexplorer investment-case files carry a "Financial Year" descriptor while historical files label the year as a plain integer with no marker. Check the descriptor row and state which basis a figure uses.
- **Month values are names, not numbers**: monthly (`1m`) files carry `Month` as `January`..`December`, not `1`..`12` - map them before sorting or filtering, or rows will parse wrong or drop.

## Data model varies by market - check first

Read the dataset/scenario options for the specific market before analysing - column names, currency, sub-daily granularity and even which datasets exist all vary. What stays constant: `system` and `technology` datasets exist where data is available; `technology` is row-keyed by class/group/subgroup (filter on the level you need); 1y/1m are broadly available. What varies:

- **Currency** is embedded in every price column (`gbp/mwh`, `eur/mwh`, `aud/mwh`, `usd/mwh`, ...). Never mix currencies across markets.
- **Sub-daily code** differs: GB & AUS use `30M`; DE, US ISOs & others use `1h` / `15M`. Read the available codes from the options.
- **Baseload/wholesale column** naming differs: GB `average wholesale market price`; DE `average wholesale electricity day ahead price` (+ intraday); US ISOs split day-ahead vs real-time hub prices.
- **Multi-region markets** split rows by sub-region (Australia NEM regions, US ISO zones) - filter on `region` too or you blend regions. Single-region markets (GB) have one region value.
- **Technology taxonomy** is three levels in rows (class -> group -> subgroup) and labels vary by market - read the actual labels from a sample rather than assuming (e.g. GB has Nuclear and Offshore wind; Australia has neither).

## Deliverables: chart + citations, every time

Two non-negotiables close every answer that uses this skill - not just combined or complex ones:

- **Render, don't narrate.** Any chart-shaped question (per "Choosing how to compute a figure" above) ends in an actual chart rendered in the code sandbox - a described number or a text table is not a substitute for the image. Duration curves: value (y) vs % of time exceeded (x). Correlograms: ACF (y) vs lag (x), lags annotated in time. Profiles: mean (y) vs hour/period/month (x). Label units + currency basis, market, period, granularity, and scenario + vintage on every chart and headline number. Check for `Hidden` cells or pending data (see conventions above) before plotting - a placeholder is not a zero.
- **Every number gets a source.** Data numbers cite surface + dataset + scenario/vintage + currency (e.g. "Scenario Explorer, Germany Q3 26 Central, system / 1y, EUR2025"; "Flexplorer investment_case, Great Britain Q2 26 Central, 4h/1cy SEW, GBP2024/kW grid"). Report claims cite title + quarter + page. Close with a **Sources** footer listing every dataset and report used, even for a single-figure answer.

Alongside those: state sample size / years covered and flag data gaps or pending responses rather than glossing over them; keep the user's data selection visible in the write-up so the basis is auditable.
